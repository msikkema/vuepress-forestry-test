title: 'Ways to Relax: Art and Design'
subtitle: You might think not everyone can turn a blank canvas into a work of art
  – these people are here to show you that you can! Or if you prefer, just sit back
  and watch others doing it! There’s a kind of magic to watching this work unfold
  and it really is soothing to just chill out and enjoy the show. Plus, if you’re
  an artist who needs some inspiration, looking to what others are doing can be a
  great way to kickstart your own creative juices.

From the wholesome and wonderful Bob Ross, this channel is full of videos about painting landscapes. He shows how you can paint along with him, and is a great example of how some [positive self-talk](https://au.reachout.com/articles/3-ways-to-talk-yourself-up) can go a long way.

In his words: “That’s alright; we don’t make mistakes here, we have happy accidents. We can learn to work with anything that happens.”

## [Kunchevsky](https://www.instagram.com/kunchevsky/)

Kunchevsky highlights how the simplest designs in art are just as appealing as the complex. All designed using a tablet, it’s a good way to bring that childhood drawing habit into the future through technology.

## [DoodleChaos](https://www.youtube.com/user/DoodleChaos/videos)

This channel combines art and music to create little figures that ride along lines to the music. These cartoons are a cool visual representation of all sorts of songs, covering genres from pop to classical music. Follow the little rider’s journey and get lost in the movement.

## [Woodworking Daily](https://www.instagram.com/woodworking.daily__/?hl=en)

A channel full of woodworkers doing their jobs with precision – there are videos to cover everything from logs being cut, to furniture being made. Give Woodworking Daily a look if this kind of hands-on craft is your thing.

## [Now I’ve Seen Everything](http://https//www.youtube.com/channel/UCPeW45oXPao55eyAYOOj7lw)

This channel is your go-to for everything design and art. From candle carving to makeup artistry, these processes, which focus on colours and shapes, will help you be present in the moment.

## [Sand.isfying](https://www.instagram.com/sand.isfying/?hl=en)

Magic sand, or kinetic sand, is regular sand that’s been coated with silicone oil (a type of oil used for art and craft). It sticks to itself, so it looks like it flows softly, and you can mould it with your hands. It’s actually used as a type of therapy for people with disabilities that impact senses like touch, so these videos are guaranteed de-stressors.
